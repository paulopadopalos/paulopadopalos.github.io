        <p>On this page you'll find links to a variety of resources which I've found useful over the years and hope you will too.</p>

          <h2>Books</h2>
          <p>The following list of books aren't related to higher education, but they cover interesting topics which I've found useful in my working life</p>

          <h3><a href="https://amzn.to/3Gi95jH"><em>The No-Asshole Rule</em></a> by Robert Sutton</h3>
          <p>Dealing with difficult people in the workplace is a universal problem and something we all have to face at times. Sutton's book is an exploration of why certain workplaces seem to enable these behaviours. A very insightful read, if a little short on strategies for dealing with them!</p>

          <h3><a href="https://amzn.to/3UuMRPw"><em>The Paradox of Choice</em></a> by Barry Schwartz</h3>
          <p>From the timetabler's perspective, too much curriculum choice is a serious problem – however many institutions pride themselves on the amount of choice they offer to students. Schwartz explores the paradox this poses. Many thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anneghjohnson/">Anne Johnson</a> for introducing me to this book.</p>

          <h2>Report Design</h2>
          <p>In <abbr title="Higher Education">HE</abbr> we produce huge numbers of reports, and given the diversity of our communities it's important to consider the accessibility of these. The following websites have helped me to develop a consistent style for reports.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/">Colouring for Colorblindness</a></h3>
          <p>My partner is colour blind, so I'm particularly aware of the importance of producing colour-blind friendly reports. This website by David Nichols is a hugely useful resource for seeing how a colour scheme will be perceived by colour blind readers. It also made me aware of the IBM colour blind safe palette which is my default colour scheme for charts.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://practicaltypography.com">Practical Typography</a></h3>
          <p>Despite their best efforts to enforce a house style, university reports often vary widely in design. Good design can make a report easier to understand though, and I find Matthew Butterick's website on typography to be an invaluable resource for this.<p>
