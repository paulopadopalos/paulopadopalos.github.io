            <p>On this page you'll find links to a variety of resources which I've found useful over the years and hope you will too.</p>

                <h3>Books</h3>
                <p>The following list of books aren't related to higher education, but they cover interesting topics which I've found useful in my working life.</p>
                <h4><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3Gi95jH">The No-Asshole Rule</a></em> by Robert Sutton</h4>
                <p>Dealing with difficult people in the workplace is a universal problem and something we all have to face at times. Sutton's book is an exploration of why certain workplaces seem to enable these behaviours. A very insightful read, if a little short on strategies for dealing with them!</p>
                <h4><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3UuMRPw">The Paradox of Choice</a></em> by Barry Schwartz</h4>
                <p>From the timetabler's perspective, too much curriculum choice is a serious problem – however many institutions pride themselves on the amount of choice they offer to students. Schwartz explores the paradox this poses. Many thanks to Anne Johnson for introducing me to this book.</p>

                <h3>Report Design</h3>
                <p>In HE we produce huge numbers of reports, and given the diversity of our communities it's important to consider the accessibility of these. The following websites have helped me to develop a consistent style for reports.</p>
                <h4><a href="https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/">Colouring for Colorblindness</a></h4>
                <p>My partner is colour blind, so I'm particularly aware of the importance of producing colour-blind friendly reports. This website by David Nichols is a hugely useful resource for seeing how a colour scheme will be perceived by colour blind readers. It also made me aware of the IBM colour blind safe palette which is my default colour scheme for charts.</p>
                <h4><a href="https://practicaltypography.com/">Practical Typography</a></h4>
                <p>Despite best efforts to enforce a house style, university reports often vary widely in design. Good design can make a report easier to understand though, and I find Matthew Butterick's website on typography to be an invaluable resource for this.</p>
