            <h2>Exam Attendance</h2>
            <h3>A tool to support attendance registers in exam halls</h3>
            <p>Exam Attendance is an iOS app which allows exam invigilators to take attendance at an examination in a number of ways. You can use the app to scan student ID cards for a barcode or piece of identifying text, and the identifier found will be logged. If scanning fails, or no suitable ID is available, you can manually enter a record for the attendee. The time of each entry is recorded, and you can optionally record the venue of the examination.</p>
            <p>Once a register has been taken you can use the Export button to share it with other people – e.g. saving it as a file or including it in an email. The register is formatted as a comma separated value file (CSV) so you can open it in spreadsheet applications such as Numbers or Excel.</p>
