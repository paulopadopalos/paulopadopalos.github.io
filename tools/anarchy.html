            <h2>Anarchy</h2>
            <h3>The classic 8-bit game, now for iOS</h3>
            <p>Anarchy is my recreation of the classic 1980s game for 8-bit computers like the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and the ZX Spectrum.</p>
            <p>On each level you must destroy all the bricks – once you've done so the exit for the level will appear. But beware - there are creatures to avoid who are immune to your weapons, so timing and planning your route are key.</p>
            <p>The original version of Anarchy was coded by Michael Sentinella and released by Hewson Associates. I played and loved this game as a child, so recreating it seemed appropriate for my first ever computer game. You can play the <a href="https://archive.org/details/Anarchy_1987_Hewson_h_TCS">original version at Archive.org</a>.</p>
