            <h2>Combo Counter</h2>
            <h3>A tool to support staff when planning their curriculum</h3>
            <p>Many degree programmes are structured as a series of choices, where students will choose either a certain number of modules (or course units), or select modules worth a specific number of credits.</p>
            <p>These rules often hide a surprising level of complexity, and even simple programmes can have hundreds if not thousands of possible pathways which can make timetable planning incredibly hard.</p>
            <p>Combo Counter will calculate the number of pathways through a programme, and by adjusting the rules you can see the impact on the number of possible pathways.</p>
            <p>The tool also calculates the number of contact hours for each pathway, thereby helping you identify any pathways which cannot be scheduled in a teaching week.</p>
            <p>The resulting pathways can be exported a spreadsheet which may be useful to timetable staff planning a timetable.</p>
