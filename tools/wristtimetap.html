            <h2>Wrist Time Tap</h2>
            <h3>Keep on schedule</h3>
            <p>Wrist Time Tap is a watchOS app to help you stay on schedule.</p>
            <p>After selecting a counter duration, the app will count down but every five minutes will discretely vibrate so that you can keep track of how much time has elapsed.</p>
            <p>This app is ideal for people in service roles who need to ensure that they aren't getting behind with their work, without giving their customers the impression that they are constantly checking the time.</p>
