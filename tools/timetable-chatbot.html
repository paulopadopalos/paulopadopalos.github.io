            <h2>Timetable Chatbot</h2>
            <h3>The world’s first chat bot for helping students with their timetables.</h3>
            <p>Rather than being hosted on a website, the chat bot was available via multiple messaging platforms - allowing students to access it using the apps they already had installed on their phones. The Timetable Chat Bot was available on Facebook Messenger, kik, LINE, Telegram, Twitter and Viber.</p>
            <p>Written in Node.js and using NLP and ML, students could ask free form questions and receive an immediate response, for example:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"When is the next lecture for MATH101?"</p>
                <p><cite>Student</cite></p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"There is a lecture for MATH101 on Tuesday at 9.00am in Roscoe Theatre A.""</p>
                <p><cite>Chatbot</cite></p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"How do I find Roscoe Theatre A?""</p>
                <p><cite>Student</cite></p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Roscoe Theatre A is located on the ground floor of the Roscoe Building. Click here for a map."</p>
                <p><cite>Chatbot</cite></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The bot was deployed at the University of Manchester for two years, but was discontinued at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic when teaching moved online.</p>
